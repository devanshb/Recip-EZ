      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our website! We are a team of college students majoring in engineering hoping to make meal planning easier for college students.</p>
      <p>The inspiration behind this website is the recognition of the challenges faced by young adults with busy schedules when it comes to preparing meals: limited culinary skills, budget restrictions, and time constraints. 
        This demographic shows a growing interest in cooking at home, driven by the desire for healthier eating habits and the necessity to manage expenses more effectively. 
        However, the lack of an optimized method for meal planning and grocery shopping is commonly an obstacle that many avoid and instead employ unhealthy or expensive coping mechanisms. 
        This application seeks to motivate users by providing a user-friendly platform that simplifies the art of easy meal prep.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting our website. We look forward to serving you and making cooking easier and healthier!</p>
